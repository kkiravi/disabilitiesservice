            <h2 class="maintop"> <h2 class="maintop">People with disabilities often encounter significant challenges when navigating public spaces. While many countries have introduced laws to improve accessibility, there are still numerous obstacles that make it difficult for people with disabilities to move freely and participate in everyday activities. One of the major issues they face is the lack of proper infrastructure designed to meet their needs.
                First, there are often physical barriers, such as staircases without ramps or elevators. For wheelchair users or people with mobility impairments, a flight of stairs can completely prevent them from entering a building or using certain facilities. Even when ramps or elevators exist, they may not always be in good condition or placed in convenient locations.
                Another common issue is the shortage of designated parking spaces for people with disabilities. These parking spots are meant to be close to the entrance of buildings, but they are often taken by people without disabilities, making it harder for those who need them to park and access important services.
                Sidewalks and public transport also pose problems. Uneven pavements, lack of curb cuts, and crowded sidewalks can make it difficult for people using mobility aids to navigate the streets. Public transportation may not always have the necessary accommodations, such as ramps or lifts, to allow people with disabilities to board buses or trains easily.
                The lack of accessible public toilets is another problem. Many public restrooms do not have the space or equipment, such as grab bars, to accommodate people with disabilities. This limits their ability to participate in public life and access essential services.
                In summary, while progress has been made in making public spaces more accessible, there is still a long way to go. Cities and governments must continue working to remove barriers and ensure that public areas are truly accessible to everyone, regardless of their physical abilities.
